Clean Mobility & EV Technology

PANEL DISCUSSION:
The evolving conscious customer landscape - What’s the next series of big innovations and technological disruptions that will drive demand for clean mobility in the future?
From public transportation to e-scooters: The entire transport industry is turning electric. The future of sustainability begins with mobility, says the UN's World Economic Forum.
Emissions from cars, trucks and other road vehicles account for 75% of all CO2 emissions from mobility, approx. 6 gigatons/year. Almost 42% of the automobiles and parts sector market is focused on lower-carbon solutions and shifting to zero direct emissions vehicles – EVs.
According to the IEA, both battery electric vehicles (406x increase) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (8304x increase) have grown dramatically since 2010. The EV industry is set to reach over $1.3 trillion in 2028 at a CAGR of 24.3%.
This session will bring together global EV and clean fuel industry to discuss how clean mobility can contribute in achieving climate goals!

Pycon MEA | When gRPC met Python

What if we can have a tool that helps us to do intelligent load balancing or What if we can do selective compression of the data and extremely fast and light weight transfer of data? Then let me introduce gRPC, the technology that helps us to do all of this and how can we integrate gRPC with Python. gRPC is one of the most new breakthroughs in the world of client server interaction. Using gRPC our client can directly make a call to a server on a different machine as if it were a local object. gRPC has low latency, high scalability and supports multiple use cases for distributed system. We can even build mobile clients which can communicate to a cloud server. gRPC uses Protocol Buffers which is an open source mechanism for serialising structured data, which makes payloads faster, smaller and simpler. In this talk we will try to understand how can we get started with gRPC in Python. grpcio package of python will be used for the demonstration of the examples and we will cover basics of gRPC as well. We will build a basic gRPC service and define protocol buffers for it. Demonstration of how a client and a server can be made through gRPC and how can they communicate.

Pycon MEA | Event-Driven Architectures with Python - Solving complexity at scale

Event-driven architectures (EDAs) and AsyncAPI are being hyped at the moment as the new big thing after REST/OpenAPI and GraphQL. Indeed, EDAs target a real need in today's application landscape, as systems grow more complex or need to scale both vertically and horizontally. Python can help build such architectures by leveraging existing event bus/queue systems or by providing the needed async interfaces directly. The talk will introduce the architecture and terminology around it, such as AsyncAPI, as well as provide insights into different components which can be managed, connected and implemented with Python. It is also meant to spark some more interest in getting Python into a more prominent position within the AsyncAPI community, where Node and Java still dominate.

You've heard async is great, it can improve concurrency performance, but you might have heard that you need to use only async code and use only async-compatible libraries... but the good news is, that's not entirely true. So, how can you take advantage of these new async features in your current projects that already use blocking code and require some blocking libraries? In this talk, I'll show you the basics of writing concurrent async code, and how to properly mix it with regular code without affecting performance (without blocking the event loop) by using thread workers underneath. All done in a simple and convenient way using modern libraries.

According to recent statistics, the global cloud computing market is expected to reach $1.2 billion by 2027, with big tech companies like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft dominating the space with their centralized cloud services. However, concerns around data ownership and privacy have led some to question the responsibility and accountability of these companies, and to advocate for community-owned cloud computing infrastructure that is more transparent and community-driven. By examining the pros and cons of each approach, this session will shed light on the importance of balancing the need for innovation and efficiency with the fundamental rights of digital citizens.

Presentation Session - Human Centric Sustainable Cities

Today we are at the very early stages in the evolution of sustainable cities, thus the features of sustainable cities are rapidly evolving as urban challenges grow, lifestyle habits change, socio-economic challenges expand and new technologies emerge. The increase rate of climate change is also fuelling new thinking in the planning of the next generation of sustainable cities, for which benchmark models are emerging.

The next evolution of sustainable cities are climate positive cities producing more energy and food than they consume. These cities are designed to provide food, energy and water security whilst also creating an inclusive city for all.

In this presentation, Baharash Bagherian CEO of URB will provide insights into how the next generation of sustainable cities will look & feel like. The talk will cover case studies from URB on the types of design strategies, initiatives and targets that need to be adopted to achieve a sustainable city and more importantly: how can we create them to be human centric?

Imagine a world where this technology play a crucial role in predicting natural disasters and their effects on urban areas. With the integration of specific digital twins of smart buildings, traffic infrastructure, power grids, and water management systems, city operations and maintenance can become much easier and efficient. Moreover, in the near future, we could see digital twins being used to simulate and test new city development projects before they are implemented. This could lead to smarter decisions and ultimately save time and money in the long run.

Panel Discussion: From creativity to chaos: Unraveling the potential dark side of Generative AI in city planning

The transition from creativity to chaos is marked by the thin line between innovation and the unknown. Generative AI, when unchecked, can push the boundaries of design to extremes that fail to account for human functionality, accessibility, and comfort. While AI's ingenuity knows no bounds, it is also unburdened by ethics, inadvertently leading us toward dystopian landscapes where technology reigns supreme, and human experience is forgotten.
