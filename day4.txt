New era of AI governance

A report by PwC suggests that the global economy could benefit from up to $15.7 trillion by 2030 with the aid of AI. Although the emergence of AI has led to remarkable advances, it also calls for novel forms of governance. The discussion on AI governance is not new, but it has become increasingly urgent as businesses and governments increasingly rely on AI and automation to make decisions, ranging from hiring people to criminal sentencing. Thus, there is a crucial need to align AI with human values and principles by establishing an efficient framework for AI governance, which must be accomplished through collaboration between industries, organizations, and governments.

Building Trust in AI for Clinicians: Explainable and Interactive Approach

AI has several avenues in medical decision-making, as AI models provide valuable insights for clinicians. However, AI models are often viewed as black boxes and can be difficult to interpret. Hence, in a high-risk field such as medicine, clinicians find it challenging to build trust and confidence in using such models. This workshop will present an explainable AI model for diagnosing Retinal OCT diseases and uncover its underlying decision-making process. The session will also explain the various ways to interact with the model, evaluate it, and interpret the results. The workshop aims to bridge the gap between clinicians' concerns and AI capabilities and embark on the journey of transforming medicine with AI.

Generative AI technologies such as ChatGPT and Bard have substantially accelerated our decades-long journey to an “AI Everywhere” reality. While discussions abound on whether these AI models will replace or complement human ingenuity for professionals ranging from programmers to artists, the societal value of democratizing such critical technologies cannot be overstated. While the explosion in size and complexity of the models and their voracity for data and compute naturally lend itself to making Generative AI the domain of a few pioneering companies, early design decisions emphasizing the use of ubiquitous hardware and open software are critical to ensuring wider future access.

Unlocking the talent sourcing constraints: tech to do the impossible, increase quality and speed while reducing costs.

Join this unique workshop to learn a practical framework for measuring the impact of new technologies on your HR function. This workshop will use proprietary data to measure the impact new technologies like AI are having on HR via applying a proven framework from project management to HR, the so-called triple constraint, to a new talent sourcing technology called a recruitment agency marketplace. If you've never heard of these before, then you need to come along to make sure you can:

1. Know the tradeoffs between different approaches to solving the same problem in HR (in this case talent sourcing)
2. Discover how we can measure this holistically and prove the business case of using technology (like recruitment agency marketplaces)
3. See practically what financial, speed and quality benefits can arise by scientifically quantifying the value such HR technologies provide.

This session would be suitable for CHRO, SVP of HR, VP of HR/talent acquisition, senior managers and managers in HR functions in medium to enterprise businesses who are looking for a way to better compete in the most difficult talent wars we have ever faced. Walk away with new tools and frameworks to measure division performance to elevate it to the next level.

Pycon MEA | Developing a culture to write reliable and performant services at scale

Python is a programming language known for its usefulness and ease of readability, making it an excellent choice for quickly creating services. These services can be scaled to millions of users. However, a myriad of problems comes hidden with it during the development phase if observability-driven development is not followed like the inability to meet the SLAs, poor performance, difficulty in tracking business metrics, etc and this can lead to anti-patterns in software. Metrics such as these can be valuable for root cause analysis, driving business goals, component-level monitoring, improving performance, and so on. In this presentation, I will discuss how to adhere to best practices for observability and reliability when building a Python service from the ground up. I will explain the meaning of each concept, how to establish a culture that promotes these practices and provide a detailed code walkthrough demonstrating how to implement these concepts effectively.
