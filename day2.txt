Introduction to Data Analysis Using Pandas

Working with data can be challenging: it often doesn’t come in the best format for analysis, and understanding it well enough to extract insights requires both time and the skills to filter, aggregate, reshape, and visualize it. This session will equip you with the knowledge you need to effectively use pandas – a powerful library for data analysis in Python – to make this process easier.This is a hands-on workshop consists of lectures using Jupyter Notebooks for following along with the code and a set of exercises dispersed throughout to test each attendee’s understanding. There are more questions provided in each section than the attendees will have time to answer so that those at all levels of prior experience have a challenge. After some time, I will go over the solutions to those exercises before resuming the lecture. This tutorial is for anyone with basic knowledge of Python and an interest in learning how to analyze data in Python. We will be working with Jupyter Notebooks, so attendees should familiarize themselves with the interface (i.e., know how to run/edit a cell) beforehand.

Pycon MEA Data Science | Incorporating large language models into practical NLP workflows

In this talk, I’ll show how large language models such as GPT-4 complement rather than replace existing machine learning workflows. Initial annotations are gathered by promting the model, and then corrected by a human decision maker using an annotation tool. The resulting annotations can then be used to train and evaluate models as normal. This process results in higher accuracy than can be achievedfrom the language model alone, with the added benefit that you’ll own and control the model for runtime.

Marketing Mania | Keynote: AI:Shift from Attention to Intimacy

As AI large language models such as ChatGPT enter our industry, we can imagine a shift from being attention-driven, towards an intimacy-driven one. Brands will be able to deliver infinite one-on-one human conversations, where the AI will self-improve, become only more knowledgeable and responsive to the customer. Training an AI model to be ‘on brand’ will be key – which means being clear and distinct about your brand is ever more critical. Brands’ product offerings will take new shape in conversational interfaces and customers looking for products will increasingly turn to chat-based interfaces.
 
This session will explore ways that brands can successfully integrate conversation into their digital ecosystem for a variety of use cases - from brand guidelines and owner’s manuals to website navigation

Pycon MEA Data Science | spaCy LLM: Using large language models to prototype and develop language processing applications

Large language models such as GPT-4 have introduced a step-change in natural language understanding technology. One application for these is in an interactive chat interface, but many applications that need to work with language instead want to process and analyse textual data. Supervised components have a big advantage in efficiency and customisability for these tasks, but they require task-specific training data. In this talk, I’ll show you how spaCy’s new support for large language models allows faster and more powerful prototyping than ever before. You can put together a custom pipeline with no training data and minimal effort to get something working almost right away. I’ll then discuss how you can build on that first effort to create applications that can deliver lasting value.

Presentation: Are generative AI models failing us?


Although generative AI models have advanced significantly in various industries, such as NLP, image and video synthesis, and music composition, they, like any other technology, are not without their limitations. Generative AI models can produce unrealistic or hallucinatory results at times, as their outputs are based on probability distributions. Additionally, these models can only process approximately 24,000 English words or 50 pages of single-spaced text per request. As it stands, the future of generative AI models will depend on addressing these issues to ensure that their potential benefits are not outweighed by their limitations.

Global Report on the Acquisition, Weaponization, and Deployment of UAS by Non-state Armed Groups for Terrorism-related Purposes

The use of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) by non-state armed groups, including for terrorism-related purposes, is a grave and growing international security threat. To counter this threat, it is essential for the international community to work together to prevent and counter the acquisition, weaponization, and deployment of UAS technology for terrorism purposes. In 2023 the United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism (UNOCT) and Conflict Armament Research (CAR) produced the first-of-its-kind baseline Global Report on the Acquisition, Weaponization, and Deployment of UAS by Non-State Armed Groups for Terrorism-related Purposes. This session will present key findings from the report and consider challenges and opportunities to further strengthen efforts to prevent and mitigate threats and risks posed by the terrorism use of UAS.

The State of Mobile Phishing in 2023: Why It’s Here to Stay

Mobile phishing is one of the most effective ways for attackers to steal employee login credentials. With legitimate usernames and passwords in hand, attackers can silently enter your infrastructure, move around freely, and access your most sensitive data. Remote work and a reliance on BYOD has caused these attacks to grow at an alarming rate.

Panel Discussion: The True Heroes of your Organizational AI Journey

• Are you talking to right stakeholders? Today we are here to throw down the gauntlet and declare that customer service and sales teams are the real heroes of your AI journey 
• Will they use the shiny new piece of tech? Project teams are often not dealing with customers, how do you ensure that the shiny new tech / AI you are aiming to graft into your organisation isn’t rejected?  
• Predictions for the future: Is it inevitable that augmented staff are going to be able to do more in less time? Have we thought about the consequences of ‘success’ and how we can ensure we don’t leave anybody behind?

PRESENTATION - Exploring the Realm of Human Factors in Cyber Security

Acknowledging the critical role of human factors in cybersecurity is essential for modern organizations. It's not just about technology; it's about understanding and addressing the human elements that can either strengthen or weaken an organization's cybersecurity posture. Developing a human factors program and integrating it into the overall cybersecurity strategy is a proactive step towards mitigating risks and ensuring the long-term security and resilience of a business.

In this presentation, we will discuss what Human Factors in Cyber Security actually entails and what methods your organisation can use immediately to begin becoming more proactive with the human element risk.
