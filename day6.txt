Devops & Java Talks, Cloud Kubernetes | The open-source movement powering generative AI

Since its open-source release, the Stable Diffusion model, and related algorithms such as Dreambooth and LoRa, have been used by hundreds of developers to create new generative AI models and applications. Beyond creating better AI models for specific themes, styles, and subjects, the open-source community has implemented innovative techniques that reduce the inference time and hardware requirements for running these models. Just as importantly, these developers have also created countless blog posts, video tutorials, and web apps that make it easier than ever for others to get started.
In this talk, we will discuss the impact of the open-source movement on the field of AI-generated images and explore some of the most exciting projects within the community, made possible by models like Stable Diffusion. We will also highlight some of the challenges and opportunities facing the community as it continues to evolve and grow in the coming years.

Devops & Java Talks, Cloud Kubernetes | Optimizing Angular apps like a Pro

Performance is very critical for many organizations using Angular. While it comes with tons of optimizations out of the box, it is still possible to optimize Angular apps further based on specific use cases. If you have worked with a medium-large scale application with Angular, you may have noticed that as your application grows and you have thousands of components in your app, the performance of the web app starts to become a concern. There could be many reasons why that could happen. And we’re going to explore a bunch of those, with potential strategies. If you want to know the secret sauce to improve your Angular Applications, then join our talk, where you will learn how to write better-performing Angular Apps or improve the performance of your existing Angular App.

Devops & Java Talks, Cloud Kubernetes | Leveraging Serverless to Gain Velocity for Your Applications

You’ve decided to move to the Cloud Native ecosystem. You have multiple options and, frankly, are overwhelmed by them. Your goal is to gain the promise of velocity that Cloud Native and containers offer you, but you aren’t sure where to start. You see things like Kubernetes, Serverless, Containers, and Functions, but know you need to understand these things before even touching your Applications.
In this talk, I’ll walk you through the Cloud Native ecosystem so you are aware of what options do exist, but then I’ll show the advantage of leveraging Code-Engine, a Serverless and Functions platform. This will give you a path to get closer to this promise of Containers and Cloud Native without dealing with the overhead of many other portions of the Cloud Native Ecosystem. I’ll start with a simple local application and deploy it to a vanilla Kubernetes cluster (or docker-compose VM), which is the typical first production step for someone on this journey. After understanding the complexities, I’ll take that same application to Code-Engine, showing the advantage of this unified platform, gaining the “focus on what makes your company money instead of infrastructure” modern-day challenge.
There are many different options in this space, but if you take this simple journey with me, you’ll learn that it’s not as complex as it seems, and if you take my advice, you’ll have an opportunity to gain that velocity you want.

In this session, we delve into the integration of ChatGPT AI with drone programming to create a more interactive and dynamic control system for the Tello drone, while also improving the productivity and effectiveness of programmers. We will explore the foundations of using Unity 3D and .NET for programming, with a focus on networking and developing a UDP Client and Server that facilitates communication with the drone. This enables us to modify and refine the drone's behavior through AI-generated messages and commands.
By leveraging ChatGPT AI, programmers can streamline their development process and receive suggestions or insights that enhance their decision-making and problem-solving abilities. This AI-driven support results in more efficient and productive development cycles.
We will also discuss the significance of AI and ChatGPT in expanding the capabilities of mixed-reality experiences. By incorporating MRTK (Mixed Reality Toolkit), attendees will gain insight into the mixed reality spectrum and learn valuable tips and tricks for entering this domain. MRTK serves as a versatile tool that simplifies the transition to AR/VR/MR development by offering an advanced volumetric UX/UI system and predefined components for cross-platform projects.
The session will culminate in a live demo or video presentation of the drone flying across multiple XR devices, showcasing the potential of AI-driven drone control systems in mixed-reality environments. The specific XR devices featured will be unveiled at the beginning of the session.
