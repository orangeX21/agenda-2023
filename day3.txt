Pycon MEA Data Science | Developing a culture to write reliable and performant services at scale

Python is a programming language known for its usefulness and ease of readability, making it an excellent choice for quickly creating services. These services can be scaled to millions of users. However, a myriad of problems comes hidden with it during the development phase if observability-driven development is not followed like the inability to meet the SLAs, poor performance, difficulty in tracking business metrics, etc and this can lead to anti-patterns in software. Metrics such as these can be valuable for root cause analysis, driving business goals, component-level monitoring, improving performance, and so on. In this presentation, I will discuss how to adhere to best practices for observability and reliability when building a Python service from the ground up. I will explain the meaning of each concept, how to establish a culture that promotes these practices and provide a detailed code walkthrough demonstrating how to implement these concepts effectively.

Angel investors face a major crossroads in 2023. With the current economic crisis, many institutional investors, such as venture capital firms, are holding tighter onto their war chests, funding far fewer entrepreneurs than they would in better times. As a result, individual angel investors may be the best hope for founders in need of an initial check. Despite this fact, angel investors may understandably also be more risk-averse in this economic environment.

Can AI help us do that in a way that’s good for the planet? This session will tackle the skeptics head-on, delving into the profound questions surrounding AI's role in product development.

A Deep dive into Urban Self-Sufficiency & Climate Change

Professionals within the built environment have a lot to think about, as cities will have to change quickly to tackle the immense issues of climate change to make them Healthy, Equitable, and Self-Sufficient.

At this point in history, the URBAN LANDSCAPE is seen only as an opportunity to make a profit by what we build upon it. Our natural systems have changed rapidly, causing even more urgency and risks to humanity.

However, the urban landscape is vital in enabling cities to ADAPT to Climate Change in the near future. SUSTAINABILITY depends heavily on Nature and Nature-Based Solutions, and the Earth can provide only so much to our growing populations and our desire for consumption. We must now begin a new way of living through recycling our economies, water, food, energy, & waste to create SELF-SUFFICIENCY for our cities. How can this be done? Let’s see….

Panel Discussion: Data initiatives behind AI: Overcoming bottlenecks and setting standards.

In the world of data science, 80% of a data scientist's time is typically consumed by the arduous tasks of finding, cleaning, and reorganizing vast amounts of data. This inefficient data strategy leaves them with a mere 20% of their time for actual data analysis. Recognizing this challenge, it becomes evident that there is a pressing need for more efficient approaches to data discovery and analysis. This session will delve into the initiatives designed to address these bottlenecks and establish robust data standards.

When we consider the future, we have a collective tendency to create abstract, escapist works, which feel like alternative worlds rather than an evolution of the present.

Dive into the history of leading futures projects for Sony, Nokia and Google to explore how to radically engage with the future, embracing it in all its complexity and messiness.

Pycon MEA Data Science | Lessons learned from teaching Data Science

In this talk, we will explore the fundamentals needed to be a data scientist, from the perspective of theory, tooling, and approaches. We will start with some of the common misconceptions people starting to learn data science have and end with a discussion of how large language models challenge the future of learning, including that of learning and teaching data science. It’s been 15 years since the term data scientist has become one of the most sought-after professions. Nevertheless, if you ask a lot of data scientists what their profession is you will get very different answers, which will mostly depend on the kinds of companies they work for. So how does one learn Data Science when the definition of the field is open to interpretation? Or, when putting together all the job descriptions, in order to become a Data Scientist one would need to know all the theory, and new approaches and be able to use hundreds of tools. In this talk, we will explore the fundamentals needed to be a data scientist, from the perspective of theory, tooling, and approaches. We will talk about some of the common misconceptions people starting to learn data science have. And about some of the reframing that I have seen successful learners have done on their path to data science. In conclusion, we will discuss how large language models challenge the future of learning, including that of learning and teaching data science.

Three Musketeers: Sherlock Holmes, Mathematics and Python

In this workshop, we will explore how Sherlock Holmes, the famous fictional detective character created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle uses Mathematics and Python programming language to solve crime mysteries. Mathematics is a science and one of the most important discoveries of the human race on earth. Math is everywhere and around us. It is in nature, music, sports, economics, engineering, and so on. In our daily life, we use mathematics knowingly and unknowingly. Many of us are unaware that forensic experts use mathematics to solve crime mysteries. In this workshop, we will explore how Sherlock Holmes, the famous fictional detective character created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle uses Mathematics and Python programming language to solve crime mysteries. In short, the workshop begins with an introduction to forensic mathematics and covers basic principles thereby setting the stage. Then, we will solve simple crime puzzles using mathematics and simple python scripts. Finally, we will solve a few complex hypothetical crime mysteries using advanced python concepts. The participants will learn how to use the concepts of mathematics such as statistics, probability, trigonometry, and graph theory, and python and its packages such as SciPy, NumPy, and Matplotlib to solve the crime puzzles.

Pycon MEA Data Science | Data morph: A cautionary tale of summary statistics

Learn how statistics can be preserved while changing a dataset's shape and how the research was translated into a package. Statistics do not come intuitively to humans; they always try to find simple ways to describe complex things. Given a complex dataset, they may feel tempted to use simple summary statistics like the mean, median, or standard deviation to describe it. However, these numbers are not a replacement for visualizing the distribution. To illustrate this fact, researchers have generated many datasets that are very different visually, but share the same summary statistics. In this talk, I will discuss Data Morph, an open source package that builds on previous research using simulated annealing to perturb an arbitrary input dataset into a variety of shapes, while preserving the mean, standard deviation, and correlation to multiple decimal points. I will showcase how it works, discuss the challenges

The conceptualization of a city as a living organism may not be new, but the idea of a city being ‘sick’ or ‘thriving’ has become even more compelling as we wrangle with the challenges of a post-COVID, climate-stressed world. In this panel on resilient ways to create resilient cities, we share insights from neuroscience and systems thinking that help us at Neurozone to conceptually shape optimization platforms that enhance a system’s capacity for elevated problem-solving, overcoming challenges, and high performance.

Live Hack Demo: IDOR - Unauthorized access; Stolen Money via Banks

A bank provides an online banking application where users can access their accounts, perform transactions, and initiate money transfers. Here's a scenario with an IDOR vulnerability; User A wants to transfer $1000 to User B. User A initiates a transfer and selects the recipient's account. However, due to an IDOR flaw in the application, the validation process fails, allowing users to select other users' accounts. In this case, User A can actually select User B's account and transfer the money, leading to unauthorized access to accounts.
